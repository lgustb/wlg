              <h2 id="1">Introduce myself</h2>
                <p>
                        I was a faculty member for 18 years at three Universities. During these years, one of my major jobs was researched, developed and facilitated courses of study on. These courses were mainly focused on Chemical and Energy areas for undergraduate students and graduate students (Please find relevant information inhttp://oldme.ustb.edu.cn/e_facultydetail.asp?ID=324). I have written fifty scientific papers on relevant periodicals, most of them were indexed by SCI(The Science Citation Index (SCI) is a citation index originally produced by the Institute for Scientific Information and created by Eugene Garfield.) or EI(EI Compendex is the broadest and most complete engineering literature database available in the world.).
                          
                        I did many translations and interpreting jobs after 1996. For Example, in February 2013, I worked as the interpreter for students in winter camp which taken place in Smiths Falls. (Please find relevant information in
                        
                        http://wintercampsmithsfalls.webs.com/
                         
                        I have four years tutorial experience for grade 9 to 12 secondary school students in Mathematics and Science in Smiths Falls, Brockville, and Ottawa.
                          
                        I also finished my criminal record check recently.

        <h2 id="2">My working experience in Qinghua University</h2>
        <p>I worked as a postdoctoral scholar from September 2002 to July 2004 in the "Post-Doctoral Research Center" of The Department of Thermal Engineering. 
 
            My responsibilities in the job included the following:
             
            ●    Complying with university and departmental standards and policies regarding the use of isotopes, chemicals, infectious agents, research animals, and human subjects as well as other policies regarding workplace safety.
             
            ●    Performing the necessary research as required by the faculty supervisor to a high standard and in accordance with all institutional regulations.
             
            ●    Working in a collegial and cooperative manner with the faculty supervisor and other co-workers.
             
            ●    Organizing and guiding the relevant scientific research team.
             
            ●    Maintenance of laboratory notebooks and/or other records of research activity.
             
            ●    Discussing and liaising with mentors in respect to the process of conducting research.
             
             
            The main projects in scientific research in which I was involved included:
             
            ●    Scientific research project, “the Separation of Residual-carbon from Fly Ash Using Flotation-column & Mercury Pollution Control on Coal-combustion ", from January 2004 to December 2004. He acted as the project leader for this particular project and received an excellent final evaluation. His responsibilities are listed as follows: responsibility for the overall project planning and implementation, coordination of various parts of the whole project, and conducting research work in critical issues. The whole project included the use of a new column flotation to separate residual carbon in fly ash, with the separated residual carbon being used as a cheap substitute for activated carbon to remove mercury in coal-fired plants, and the removed mercury then being recycled.  The total cost of residual carbon is less than that of commercial activated carbon.
             
            ●    Scientific research project, “Fundamental Research on Coal-fired Pollutants Removal —Emissions and Control of Trace Heavy Metals Elements". He worked as Sub-Leader in this project. His responsibilities are listed as follows: planning and implementation the research for the emission of Trace Elements ( Hg, Se and As ) in the coal-burning process. His work involved organizing his team in experiment design, data collection and its mechanism study. The task of his team especially focused on the formation, migration, emission and suppression of mercury pollutants in coal-fired power plants.
             
           I have undertaken primary responsibility for the development of my research projects independently and successfully. I published at least four academic papers which were indexed by EI during this period. He was rewarded with "a degree of excellence" in my final evaluation upon leaving the Post-Doctoral Research Center.
